# bs-alert

Generates what is mostly a [boostrap alert](https://www.ember-bootstrap.com/api/classes/Components.Alert.html). 

In addition to the standard look and functionality, we:
 - Have a font-awesome close icon to match OSF styling;
 - Gave the close button an aria-label to work well with i18n.
